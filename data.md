# LDP Application — Logical Data Model

**Project:** NCUA OHR Leader Development Program Application (RITM0069731)
**Scope:** Phase I
**Backend:** SharePoint lists (Power Apps)

High-level metadata for the form and list fields is provided below. Choice field values (competencies, ECQs, statuses, and similar) are cataloged in the traceability matrix (Appendix B), not here.

## Conventions

- One SharePoint list per section. Field structure follows the accepted SRS sample: Field Name, Data Type, Required?, Description.
- Relationships use SharePoint Lookup columns (target list named in the Data Type), except append-only logs.
- `NOTIFICATIONS` and `CHANGE_HISTORY` store `ApplicationID` as a plain Number (not a Lookup) to preserve the log if parent data changes.
- Supporting documents (resume, statement of interest, performance rating) are native SharePoint attachments on the `APPLICATIONS` item.
- Committee scoring is hybrid: `FinalScore` is a queryable Number used for ranking; the per-criterion breakdown is stored as JSON in a memo field.
- Identity is M365/SharePoint (email as identity); there is no custom Users/Roles list in Phase I.

Solid lines are Lookup relationships; dashed lines are the append-only logs (related by ID value, not a Lookup). `||--o{` is one-to-many; `APPLICATIONS ||--o| PLACEMENTS` is one-to-zero-or-one (an applicant has at most one placement).

## Notes

- **APPLICATIONS.Status values are inferred from the use cases** (Draft, Submitted, Complete, Incomplete, Placed, Not Selected), not read from a source field spec. Validate against how the application implements state.
- **Choice field values are deferred to the traceability matrix** (Appendix B), matching the accepted SRS sample.
