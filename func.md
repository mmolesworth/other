## Notes and open items

- **RQ023–RQ025 (supervisor recommendation).** Revised from an earlier "supervisor revises selections" model at DTD's request. Supervisors now *recommend* alternative program options without altering the applicant's selections; the recommendation informs DTD at placement only (RQ045) and does not affect committee pooling. UC-2.1 still describes the older revise model and needs the same correction in a later use-case cleanup pass.
- **RQ058–RQ061 (reminder repetition) depend on an open customer question.** These state only each reminder's first fire, per Appendix D. Appendix D does not define whether reminders repeat. If the customer confirms repetition, each needs a repeat clause or a separate requirement.
- **Phase II reminders excluded.** Appendix D's Detail Entry and Consult Date Request triggers fire for Phase II stages and are out of scope here.
- **Change history not yet a standalone requirement.** The change history is referenced by RQ025, RQ031, and RQ068 but is not established as a capability by its own requirement. Candidate consolidation: a single requirement stating the system shall maintain a change history of consequential actions on an application (what changed, who, when), which the individual references point to.
- **Requirements originating from design decisions (beyond the RITM).** RQ011, RQ014, RQ024–RQ025, RQ030, RQ047–RQ054, and RQ087–RQ092 encode decisions made during use-case work rather than lines from the RITM. Correct, but these are the statements a reviewer may not recognize from the source requirements.
- **Excluded by prior decisions.** No eligibility-enforcement requirements (eligibility is not a system concern); no capacity requirements (DTD-managed, outside the system); no PDF/Word format-restriction requirement (treated as applicant instruction, not system behavior).
- **UI impact of RQ023.** The endorsement screen (Appendix B mockup, page 2) needs a recommended-options field added.
